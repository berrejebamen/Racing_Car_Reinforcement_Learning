# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Car Racing Simulation in OpenAI Gym V2

This repository contains our research and implementation of deep reinforcement learning to simulate car racing in the OpenAI Gym V2 environment. The project was inspired and adapted from a pre-existing GitHub project, with significant parameter tuning and insights drawn from the paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning".
